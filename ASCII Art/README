====== Implementation of matching between the pixel and its corresponding brightness ======
I used hash map to store the brightness of each character. Stored in charToBrightness.

====== (1) findDuplicate ======
The idea: I referred to each value of the given array as an index, that is - I cycled through
the array according to each numList[i]. The oneStep variable goes one step, and the
twoStep variable goes two steps. In this way, detecting a cycle in the array is equivalent
to detecting the duplicate number in the array. Due to the pigeon hole principle, a cycle
is promised, and the oneStep variable and twoStep variable would meet, and we will
find the duplicate.

====== (2) uniqueMorseRepresentations ======
I stored each morse code to its corresponding alpha-bet letter in a hash map.
Then, I used a set and added all morse coded words to it. Due to the fact
that the data structure is a set, duplicate words will not be inserted into it,
that is only the unique morse code words will be in the set, and so the size of the set
is the number of unique morse representations.
